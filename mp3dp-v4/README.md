MP3DP V4 == Repeat V2 related notes and resources.  See Official V1E [MP3DP V4 Docs](https://docs.v1e.com/mp3dp), they reference :
-  [*Repeat V2* forum thread](https://forum.v1e.com/t/repeat-v2/33330) containing design process/updates/feedback. 
- [Fusion 360 hosted Design](https://myhub.autodesk360.com/ue29a24ab/g/shares/SH35dfcQT936092f0e43b20f88cb61d3441a), export/download and print these parts for latest greatest design.  Related forum post is [here](https://forum.v1engineering.com/t/repeat-v2/33330/85?u=vicious1).
  - Can use [export-components.py](https://github.com/aaronse/v1engineering-mods/blob/main/mp3dp-v4/scripts/export-components.py) Python script to export .STL files.  Included a snapshot of exported .STLs in the [/models](https://github.com/aaronse/v1engineering-mods/tree/main/mp3dp-v4/models) subfolder.  
    - As-is models will need orienting before splicing and printing.
- ~~[Printable](https://www.printables.com/model/282346-mp3dp-v4)~~ .STL files will be stable, but not latest.

## <big>Why build one?</big>
Mostly Fun, and, maybe profit.  Have an Ender 3 Max, great machine but has limited speed/quality/temps.  Want something faster and capable of other printing other materials, not just higher temp ASA/ABS/PC, TPU will be easier with direct drive instead of bowden.  

Super secret goal, arguably the most important one...  is to inspire and lure the kids into 3D printing, a gateway to becoming a Maker...

### **Why others built one...**
- Dan/SupraGuy perspective @ https://forum.v1e.com/t/mp3dp-v2/37092/7?u=azab2c


### **Low Cost (Parts, not labor...)**

- Dan's costs https://forum.v1e.com/t/mp3dp-v2/37092/3?u=azab2c

### Performance / Reliablity

<mark>TODO:</mark>

### Alternatives considered :
- https://vorondesign.com/
- https://us.ratrig.com/3d-printers/v-core.html


## <big>BOM / Parts</big>
- Ryan prints with PLA, am using PETG, may end up with ASA.


## <big>Assembly</big>
