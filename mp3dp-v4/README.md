MP3DP V4 related notes/links.


## Why build one?
Have Ender 3 Max, great machine but has limited speed/quality/temps.  Want something faster and capable of other printing other materials, not just higher temp ASA/ABS/PC, TPU will be easier with direct drive instead of bowden.


### Low Cost (Parts, not labor...)

- Dan's costs https://forum.v1e.com/t/mp3dp-v2/37092/3?u=azab2c

### Performance / Reliablity
