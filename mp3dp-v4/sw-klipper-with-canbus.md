  - Follow latest docs, or info in this video if they still apply.  In short, you'll probably...
    - Use [Pi imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to create MainSail flavored Pi OS image (will contain Klipper snapshot).
    - Boot up and connect to your Pi, called mine _repeat.local_
    - Configure, build and copy Klipper firmware to Octopus/Controller
      - Configured using ```make menuconfig``` and followed some relevant details in Voron [Build Firmware Image](https://docs.vorondesign.com/build/software/octopus_klipper.html#build-firmware-image).
      - Also used https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-OCTOPUS-V1.0/blob/master/Firmware/Klipper/README.md#basic-configuration
      - Example Voron Trident Klipper Octopus v1.1 (STM32F446) [printer.cfg](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Trident/blob/main/Firmware/Octopus/Trident_Octopus_Config.cfg).  Has similar hardware to V1E MP3DP v4, but each line needs reviewing, e.g. diff end stops setup.
      - Build klipper firmware via ```make klipper```
      - Copy to built klipper.bin to firmware.bin on SD card for Octopus/Controller

### Klipper WebCam setup
For download, install and configure info, see [Klipper - Multiple Cameras - Mainsail - Fluidd - Chris's Basement - 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAQ1lkUC-nM).  Shows how to setup 1-many WebCam.

Ensure camera interface is enabled... ```sudo raspi-config```
Test the camera works... ```raspistill -o test.jpg.``` download and view image, can use winscp or similar.

If logs contain dependency errors, e.g. streamer lib not install, then may need to install/build crowsnest...

```
cd crowsnest
sudo make install
```

If ```mjpg-streamer``` dependency is missing for some reason... 
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mjpg-streamer
```

Discover id for USB Cams via...
```
dir /dev/v4l/by-id

```

Edit, save, and restart Klipper, maybe restart Pi host even

  - Misc conversations suggesting to use U2C (USB to CANBUS adapter) since that'll be more reliable than
  - CANBUS protocol uses 2 wire high-low [Differential_signalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_signalling), so twisted pair of stranded wire is best.  AWG22 or thicker??? to carry ~50W (24v at ~2amp) for hot-end, fans, sensors, BL touch, etc...

#### CANBus wiring

Was going to use a [stranded Cat-6 Ethernet Patch cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01INRUFGK) I have already.  Despite being very popular with ~122,000 reviews, am not going to use after cutting and examining the wires to learn they're just ~26 AWG, or thinner even...

Instead am using Cat 5 24AWG stranded copper.  One pair for CANBus high/low, two pairs for power.  Grounded the final pair with the naive hope of helping shield comms.  Only grounded at end closest to controller

problem: Katapult scripts failing, ifconfig not listing can0

#### Config, Build and Upload Firmware to Octopus and EBB:
Based on info at https://klipper.discourse.group/t/setup-ebb36-v1-2-connected-to-octopus-pro/6617/5?u=azab2c

- Edited ```/etc/rc.local``` per https://github.com/Arksine/Katapult/issues/72#issuecomment-1501347910
- Looked up what "allow-hotplug" does.  Considered changing to "auto", but am wondering whether lack of can0 indicates EBB and/or Octopus USB-to-CAN bridage CANBus device is not being detected, and/or Klipper printer.cfg isn't configured to enable CAN even if the build is.  Am questioning everything at this point given how long root causing missing can0 is taking.
- Powered off.  Added jumper to EBB's 120R pins.  Powered on.

- Added jumper to Octopus boot0, reset Octopus, should go into DFU mode.
- Check Octopus is in DFU mode via ```lsusb```, verify output contains ```0483:df11 STMicroelectronics STM Device in DFU Mode```.  Note ```0483:df11 STMicroelectronics STM Device in DFU Mode``` is common, but could change.  If you see a different Identifier, be sure to use that instead for the instructions that follow.
- Use dfu-util to upload octopus_katapult.bin and octopus_klipper.bin, follow steps described in https://klipper.discourse.group/t/setup-ebb36-v1-2-connected-to-octopus-pro/6617/5?u=azab2c
  ```
  sudo dfu-util -a 0 -D ~/katapult/octopus_katapult.bin --dfuse-address 0x08000000:force:mass-erase:leave -d 0483:df11
  ```
- Check Octopus is still in DFU mode.  Previous flash step may have take controller out of DFU mode.  Press reset button to re-enter DFU again.  Ensure ```lsusb``` is still listing device with ```0483:df11 STMicroelectronics STM Device in DFU Mode``` or whatever identifier your Controller board type normally returns.
  ```
  sudo dfu-util -a 0 -D ~/klipper/octopus_klipper.bin --dfuse-address 0x08008000:leave -d 0483:df111
  ```
- Remove Octopus boot0 jumper and reset.


- Ensure correct baud rate specified in Klipper printer.cfg, edit [mcu] section, [https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_Reference.html?h=mcu+baud#mcu](https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_Reference.html?h=mcu+baud#mcu).

- Query CANBus status, checks can0 interface is working and that Katapult on Octopus is running...
    ```
    cd ~/katapult/scripts
    python3 ~/kanBoot/scripts/flash_can.py -q
    ```

- Get Octopus Serial Id
```
ls /dev/serial/by-id
```

- Flash Klipper to Octopus via Katapult serial command
```
cd ~/katapult/scripts
pip3 install pyserial
python3 flash_can.py -f ~/klipper/octopus_klipper.bin -d <serial_device>

For example...

python3 flash_can.py -f ~/klipper/octopus_klipper.bin -d /dev/serial/by-id/usb-katapult_stm32f446xx_2A0005001850344D30353320-if00
```

ifconfig should list can0

<mark>~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0</mark>

Returned canbus identifiers for Octopus and EBB36 just once.  After that they were not displayed.  Spent many many hours trying to figure out why the ~~"devices are not being listed, so they must be broken"~~, well...  Turns out I didn't RT*M the scattered docs enough, ð¤¦ââï¸, [Klipper Docs > CANBus](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper/blob/master/docs/CANBUS.md) says... 
- *"Note that the canbus_query.py tool will only report uninitialized devices - if Klipper (or a similar tool) configures the device then it will no longer appear in the list."*

So, if the devices not being displayed means they're working, or, maybe that they're not connected...  Not ideal.  So, am verifying CANBus is connected and configured by exercising end-to-end functionality, testing stepper motion, and EBB36 connected hotend/fan/extruder motion.

- Power down EBB36.  Ensure power is only provided by USB-C, i.e. ensure CANBus cable not connected.  Add jumper to VUSB header.
- Power up EBB.  Boot EBB36 into DFU mode (press and hold BOOT and RESET buttons, then release RESET before releasing BOOT).
- Check Pi can see EBB36 is connected, and in DFU mode using ```lsusb```.  Output should include something like...
  - ```
    0483:df11 STMicroelectronics STM Device in DFU Mode
    ```
  -  Note the ```0483:df11```, use/substitute that identifier in the following steps.
- Flash Katapult firmware to EBB36...

```
sudo dfu-util -a 0 -D ~/katapult/ebb_katapult.bin --dfuse-address 0x08000000:force:mass-erase:leave -d 0483:df11 
```

- Flash Klipper firmware to EBB36...

<mark>2024/1/23 DID NOT WORK with offset 0x08008000 (ie. 32kb)!  Edited to 0x08002000 but haven't tried, next time...ð¤·ââï¸  ENDED UP USING Katapult upload mentioned later in this doc</mark>

```
sudo dfu-util -a 0 -D ~/klipper/ebb_klipper.bin --dfuse-address 0x08002000:leave -d 0483:df11
```

- Power down EBB36.  Remove USB-C cable from Pi to EBB.  
- Remove VUSB jumper.  Add 120R jumper.  
- Connect fan to EBB36.  Consider delaying connecting other components to EBB36 until getting fan connected to EBB36 working.
- Connect CANBus cable.
- Ensure USB-C (re)connected from Pi to Octopus
- Reset Octopus
- Verify
