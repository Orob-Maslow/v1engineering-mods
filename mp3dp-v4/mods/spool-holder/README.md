## Spool Cradle


## Background context:
- Was originally using FuManchu's [Spool Cradle (Improved)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3407527/remixes) on thingiverse.  The Spool_Carriage_Side_Light.stl works but the beam isn't snug, the whole assembly is unstable, there's got to be a better way...  Am reusing existing parts where possible since I have some printed already.  So, am just creating a new cradle with channels for the Spool Cradle to nest into.
