- aza-lid-2020-145-template-v2.stl template used to drill mounting holes in Polycarbonate before solvent welding.  Includes alignment lip on 2 sides.

- aza-lid-2020-145-template.stl template like above, without raised alignment lips.

- During extrusion assembly with blind joint.  To avoid extrusion rotating tried printed shim 246159-misumi-2020-blind-joint-alignment-nut/v2 flush.stl from [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/246159-misumi-2020-blind-joint-alignment-nut).  Was too weak, didn't use in the end.
