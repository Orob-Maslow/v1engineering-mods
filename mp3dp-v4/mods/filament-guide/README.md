# PTFE Guide ideas for enclosed MP3DP, or other CoreXY’s even

Created [this Topic](https://forum.v1e.com/t/ptfe-guide-ideas-for-enclosed-mp3dp-or-other-corexys-even/38680) to explore PTFE guide and gantry wiring setups.  Something reliable that doesn’t negatively impact quality/speed, or make a racket slapping PTFE against the panels.

Looking to enclose my MP3DP v4 and tidy up my PTFE/Wiring setup. Typical 1000+ mm/s 3D printer builds seem to be open with massively long lengths of reverse bowden PTFE towering over the top of the Printer. Would like a compact setup to help minimize overall height, helping reduce space taken up, and reduce heat energy required/lost.

Currently using @niget2002’s clever [MP3DP v4 Bowden Holder ](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5968992) that sneakily weaves between the rear belts.

Looked at a few different setups, including…

* Voron Trident, doesn’t do much to guide PTFE within the chamber, will just loop out the back.
  * Steve covers PTFE guide assembly in his [Voron Trident Build live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXFGQMVvHrs)
    * 2:04:00 Steve recommends PTFE Feed tube be 3mm inside diameter. Less friction that the usual 1.75 ID.
    * 2:04:45 Steve’s collection of all the PTFE.
    * 2:06:00 Mounting and securing PTFE guide parts.

* Bambu setup and related Mods, for example this popular [PTFE guide mod ](https://www.printables.com/model/338073-bambu-x1-ptfe-extruder-bracket-ams-error-fix) created to address a common AMS error. Misc interesting remixes of the remix:

* Creality K1
  * Similar to Bambu setup, but seems to have design flaw where drag chain can cause PTFE tube to come loose. The drag chain can unintentionally hit the PTFE disengage switch on the hotend, details in this [YouTube review by 3D printing zone](https://youtu.be/FPjTeTDb7r8?t=783).

Currently leaning towards something that’s a combination of all the good things above. Cheers!
