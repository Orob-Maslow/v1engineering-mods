Some notes related to the Pi+TFT35 Case I end up using/modding/creating...

# Goals
- Must be pretty, pro look and feel
- Must not see any wiring.
- Must Pivot for convenient viewing angle, and access to enclosure parts
- Must Mount to 2020
- Must Be compact, but not melt.
- Should have gratuitious LED lighting.  Need to one up MK4.
- Nice to end up with design that can be reused for other projects.

# Parts

- [GeeekPi Pi 4 TFT 3.5" Resistive Touch Screen, with Case, Fan and Heatsinks. 320x480 resolution](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083C12N57)
- [HOTNOW Short USB C Cable Right Angle 1ft, 3 pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B092KF36T6)


# Printing

- Used PETG for better temp resilience and more flex/spring to help parts fit without cracking.
- Infill: Cura's Tri-Hexagon infill at 25% goes well with the Hexagon vent holes.
