 # V1E LowRider 3 mod - Vac Hose Adapters/mounts/parts


## Purpose
All things Vac Hose related.  Used [Clear flexible PVC 2-1/2" vac hose](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M6C4M9J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for my build.  Like most things, dimensions for hoses vary slightly between manufacturers.  Note the files here were designed/tweaked exactly for my [LR3 build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ7nYio8oOE).  So, you may need to tweak model(s), and/or use electrical/duct tape layer(s) to get a snug acceptably air sealed fit.
