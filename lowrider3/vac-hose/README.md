 # V1E LowRider 3 mod - Vac Hose Adapters/Mounts

![image](vac_hose_build_25pct.jpg)

## Purpose
Sharing info about the mix of LR3 Vac Hose related parts used in my build.

## Parts
- Used [Clear flexible PVC 2-1/2" vac hose](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M6C4M9J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for my build.  Like most things, dimensions for hoses vary slightly between manufacturers.  
- Created/remixed [vac-hose-adapter_2.5inch.stl](vac-hose-adapter_2.5inch.stl)<br/>
  - Created using [vac-hose-adapter_2.5inch.scad](vac-hose-adapter_2.5inch.aza.scad).  Parameterized script can be used to make Vac Adapters with/without flanges.<br/>

- Created/remixed [makita-tool-mount](../makita-tool-mount/README.md).  Use to attach Makita router to Core, and attach Vac Hose with reusable zipties.<br/>

- Used [Doug Joseph](https://www.youtube.com/@design8studio)'s _makita-vac-lower...stl_ and _makita-vac-upper...stl_ from [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/212623-lowrider-3-cnc-makita-700-series-mount-removable-d).<br/>

## Usage
The OpenScad .scad file(s) contain comments describing how to modify dimensions for your build.

Use these mods to help create a clean healthy environment.  Lung cancer and respiratory illnesses suck.


## Remarks / History

Note the files here were designed/tweaked exactly for my [LR3 build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ7nYio8oOE).  So, you may need to tweak model(s), and/or use electrical/duct tape layer(s) to get a snug acceptably air sealed fit.
