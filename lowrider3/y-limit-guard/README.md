New designed parts are solid purple.  The dark hatched shape is the existing LR3 Y drive mount that this mod will be attached to.

## Purpose / Problem
LR3 Y axis limit switches are proud and prone to being knocked when LR3 is being stored/relocated.  Spring metal arms on the switches often fly out and are a PITA to find and reattach.

This guard is designed to protect the limit switch, while also being very easy to mount to the existing Y drive mount.

Created for my LR3 build after spring arms came off 3+ times.

## Parts
Consider printing in PETG.  Typically, PLA is brittle and less flexible.

## Alternatives

See https://forum.v1e.com/t/limit-switch-arms/36804, some folks are happily using more robust hall effect switches (magnetic based).
