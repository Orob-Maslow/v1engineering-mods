## Problem / Fix
Remix of [V1E/Ryan's Kobalt Vac mount](https://www.printables.com/model/628738-kobalt-router-lr3-mount), with these mods :

- Closed hole for LED, added 2 thin areas close to LEDs to help maximize light passing through.  
- Included perimeter ridges around the LED areas, goal being to maintain/increase part strength/rigidity, but not block/reduce airflow.
- Removed funnel to help increase router airflow and cooling.
- Made part less stabby, rounded corners near opening for spindle lock.
