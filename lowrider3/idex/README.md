<mark style="opacity:0.4">
TODO: So much to do, so little time...</mark>
<br/><br/><br/>


# History < ~now < Plan
- Calibrate printer
  - https://teachingtechyt.github.io/calibration.html
  - Test Cube, Temp, Retract Towers (FAIL, too hot,)
- Investigate Print Fan Duct/Shroud options...
  - https://forum.v1e.com/t/mp3dp-repeat-h2-build/32485/17?u=azab2c
- Resist urge to make own Fan Duct...  Fail, and end up designing and sharing one...
  - https://www.printables.com/model/599054-biqu-h2-revo-part-cooling-fan-duct
- More Temp/Retract to testing bridging/flow
- Print 1st Core
  - https://forum.v1e.com/t/lowrider-3-azas-idex-upgrade-2-routers/40040/10?u=azab2c
- Print 2nd Core
~now
- Unboxing
- Design SSR multi router wiring, 
- Order SSR, DIN rail mounted?
- Core Assembly
- Controller Wiring
- Controller Box mods
- Power distribution, DIN rail mounts?

### Calibration
Building a precise machine requires precisely printed parts using a well calibrated printer.  

[Lots of test models](https://www.printables.com/model?category=12&period=all-time) out there to choose from.  Plan is to start with Teaching Tech to do small quick tests...

- https://www.printables.com/model?category=12&period=all-time

Then eventually work towards test parts that verify dimensional accuracy, including checking for skew/racking/twisting.
