### Calibration
Building a precise machine requires precisely printed parts using a well calibrated printer.  

[Lots of test models](https://www.printables.com/model?category=12&period=all-time) out there to choose from.  Plan is to start with Teaching Tech to do small quick tests...

- https://teachingtechyt.github.io/calibration.html
- https://www.printables.com/model?category=12&period=all-time

Then eventually work towards test parts that verify dimensional accuracy, including checking for skew/racking/twisting.
